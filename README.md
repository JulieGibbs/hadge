# Hadge - Health.app Data Git Exporter (for iOS)

This app serves one simple purpose: Exporting workout data from the Health.app on iOS to a git repo on GitHub. 

At the first launch of the app, you can connect your GitHub account, then the app checks whether a repo with the name `health` exists and, if not, it automatically creates it as a private repo. The initial export dumps all workouts, distances, and daily activity data (the rings on Apple Watch) to .csv files, one per year. The app also registers a background task that gets activated whenever you finish a new workout and then updates the .csv files.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Once you have set up the app (and done some workouts), you can use an Actions workflow to generate workout stats on your GitHub profile. Here's the one from [mine](https://github.com/ashtom):

Steps:

1. Create the file `.github/scripts/hadge.rb` with this [Ruby script](https://gist.github.com/ashtom/1cd9602b122082827b38eb79d605ca1a).
2. Adjust the `DISPLAYED_ACTIVITIES` near the top of the script to match your top workouts. More than 5 won't fit into a pinned gist.
3. Create the file `.github/workflows/hadge.yml` with this [workflow](https://gist.github.com/ashtom/0ca3193ce0ac76f9c6bf0b3aa9cad124).
4. Enable Actions on your repo.
5. Create a new public GitHub Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/).
6. Create a personal access token with the gist scope [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Copy it.
7. Go yo your repo settings, tab `Secrets`.
8. Create a secret `GH_TOKEN` with the personal access token copied in step 6.
9. Create a secret `GIST_ID` with the ID of the gist from step 5. The ID is the last part of the gist's URL.
10. Trigger an Actions run, either by finished a workout ðŸ™ƒ or by tapping on a workout in the app, then on the âŠ• icon in the bottom-right corner.

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in Hadge for iOS.

We do not collect, use, save, or shared any of your personal data. Hadge exports your workout data to a private GitHub repository in your personal GitHub account. To do this, the app needs access to your Health data. You can choose to disable this at any time in the Health app or by deinstalling Hadge app.

Hadge does not collect any data for any other purposes, and does not send any data to any service other than GitHub. The connection between Hadge and GitHub is directly established through the GitHub API, secured by SSL, and authenticated through your GitHub user. You can delete this connection at any time by revoking the token in your GitHub account settings or by deinstalling Hadge app.

We donâ€™t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
