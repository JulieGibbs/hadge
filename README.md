## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in Hadge for iOS.

We do not collect, use, save, or shared any of your personal data. Hadge exports your workout data to a private GitHub repository in your personal GitHub account. To do this, the app needs access to your Health data. Please provide this access through the button below. You can choose to disable this at any time in the Health app or by deinstalling Hadge app.

Hadge does not collect any data for any other purposes, and does not send any data to any service other than GitHub. The connection between Hadge and GitHub is directly established through the GitHub API, secured by SSL, and authenticated through your GitHub user. You can delete this connection at any time by revoking the token in your GitHub account settings or by deinstalling Hadge app.

Our applications donâ€™t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
