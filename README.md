This app serves one simple purpose: Exporting workout data from the Health.app on iOS to a git repo on GitHub. 

At the first launch of the app, you can connect your GitHub account, then the app checks whether a repo with the name `health` exists and, if not, it automatically creates it as a private repo. The initial export dumps all workouts, distances, and daily activity data (the rings on Apple Watch) to .csv files, one per year. The app also registers a background task that gets activated whenever you finish a new workout and then updates the .csv files.

## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in Hadge for iOS.

We do not collect, use, save, or shared any of your personal data. Hadge exports your workout data to a private GitHub repository in your personal GitHub account. To do this, the app needs access to your Health data. You can choose to disable this at any time in the Health app or by deinstalling Hadge app.

Hadge does not collect any data for any other purposes, and does not send any data to any service other than GitHub. The connection between Hadge and GitHub is directly established through the GitHub API, secured by SSL, and authenticated through your GitHub user. You can delete this connection at any time by revoking the token in your GitHub account settings or by deinstalling Hadge app.

We donâ€™t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
